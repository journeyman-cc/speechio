# Compose

The compose stage of [the pipeline](intro.html) takes 
[Toulmin structures](toulmin.html) and returns idiomatic sentences in the idiom/
dialect of the responding NPC. It's likely that sentences will be generated with
some form of markup to influence the performance of the [deliver](deliver.html)
phase.

This markup may be [Speech Synthesis Markup Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/), but I suspect that that does not provide enough expressive richness.
